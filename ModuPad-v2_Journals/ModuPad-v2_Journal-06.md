# ModuPad PCB Redesign: Lessons Learned from V1

While I was measuring my PCB—component measurements, spacing between components, and overall dimensions—I noticed that the PCB measurements were not symmetric, and it would look ugly if it were not a perfect C-shape. Because of that, I decided to place all the components’ 3D models to take a closer look at the design. I have provided a render so it can be viewed as well.

After carefully reviewing and reanalyzing everything, I came to the conclusion that I will redesign the PCB again, as the current version is not very satisfying and looks quite ugly. The whole point of this project is to improve V1 and make a better version—something I was not able to achieve in my previous design.

So, here is the new plan. I will interchange the positions of the encoders and the nice!view. Currently, the nice!view is hard to see from different angles besides the front. After changing its position, it will be easier to view from other angles, such as from the key side. Previously, the three encoders were in the way, but they will not be in the next PCB design.

Next, I plan to make the entire PCB as compact as possible, because the current design occupies unnecessary desk space. It would be wasteful to have a large macropad when its purpose is to provide efficiency and modularity in a small form factor.

Tomorrow, I will start working on the new design. Right now, it is getting very late, and I need to sleep ASAP—otherwise, my mom will seize my PC and ground me for a week, and then I will not be able to continue this project at its current pace.

See you, folks.
