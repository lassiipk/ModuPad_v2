Before starting the 3D modeling work in Autodesk Fusion 360, I sketched the PCB measurements for ModuPad_v2. The sketch is not to scale; however, all measurements are accurate and were taken directly using KiCad’s measuring tools. These measurements will be used as the foundation for the 3D modeling process in Fusion 360.

The purpose of defining these measurements early is efficiency. In the previous version of ModuPad, I did not plan ahead because I was following the HackPad blueprint-guided tutorial. In this iteration, I am creating the design from scratch, applying the knowledge gained from my first electronics and development project. I am looking forward to using these measurements to proceed with the CAD work.

## Timeline

- Start: ~5:00 PM — 23 Jan 2026
- End: ~8:40 PM — 23 Jan 2026
- Journal entry written: ~8:45 PM — 23 Jan 2026

*Planned continuation: Work on the project’s CAD case, improving a lot of things for this new version, really looking forward to it.*
