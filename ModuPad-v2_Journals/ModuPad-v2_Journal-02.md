## Unfinished Schematic — ModuPad_v2

Today’s work focused on developing the **ModuPad_v2 schematic**, which proved more challenging than expected. The primary difficulty was locating appropriate schematic symbols and matching footprints, a process that consumed significant time and required multiple revisions. Despite several setbacks and restarts, steady progress was made, and the schematic has reached a workable—though incomplete—state.

After approximately **12 hours** of concentrated effort, progress slowed due to fatigue. Work was paused intentionally to avoid errors and will resume after sleep (My mom will kill me if i dont). The schematic is still unfinished and will be continued alongside PCB work in the next session.
