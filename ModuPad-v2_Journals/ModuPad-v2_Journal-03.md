## Finished with Schematic

Wrapped up the **schematic work** today. This session was smoother compared to the earlier one, mostly focused on cleaning things up and finalizing connections that were left open before. Everything aligned with the original plan, and the schematic now feels solid and readable without second-guessing.

It took about **4 hours** to complete after the previous journal. Next step is moving straight into PCB design using the sketch from the very first journal.

### Timeline
- **Start:** ~2:30 PM — 21 Jan 2026  
- **End:** ~6:00 PM — 21 Jan 2026  
- **Journal entry written:** ~7:30 PM  
- **Planned continuation:** PCB design session (based on initial sketch)

### Current Status
- 5×5 key matrix finalized.
- 3 encoders with push button added. 
- One display (nice!view)
- Each Key has its own LED (SK6812MINI-E) .  
- Single resistor at the first LED and a shared capacitor for all LEDs  
- MCU wiring clearly defined

> Next is PCB. It'll be so fun.
